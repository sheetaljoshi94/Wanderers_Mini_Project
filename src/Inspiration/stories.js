This may sound like science-fiction, but it all begins with a space journey. Around 150 million kilometers away, massive flares from the sun send bursts of charged particles streaming toward Earth. Around 40 hours later, when the particles in our upper atmosphere collide with atoms, that's when things really start to get interesting.</p>

                            Unfortunately, there is no magic on-off switch for these lights, 
                            although they are most likely to occur in Scandinavia during wintertime. 
                            Night-time darkness is necessary for viewing, so schedule your trip between September and April
                             when the sunset times are in your favor (ideally October - March).
